## 🚀 How to Provide to Claude Code

### Step 1: Give Primary Instructions
Start with this command:
```
I need you to rebuild my language learning app with a clean, database-first architecture. I have detailed documentation for the complete implementation.

Please read through all the documents I'm providing and implement this step-by-step. The goal is to eliminate all hardcoded content and build everything from my PostgreSQL database.

Focus especially on the comprehensive learning cards - that's the key feature I want.
```

### Step 2: Provide All Documents in Order

#### Document 1: Architecture Overview
```
Here's the overall architecture design:

[Paste the entire "Clean UI/UX Architecture - Database-First Design" content]
```

#### Document 2: Implementation Instructions  
```
Here are the step-by-step implementation instructions:

[Paste the entire "Claude Code Implementation Instructions" content]
```

#### Document 3: Main App Component
```
Here's the complete clean app implementation:

[Paste the entire "Clean App Implementation - Database-First Components" code]
```

#### Document 4: API Routes
```
Here are all the API routes you need to create:

[Paste the entire "Clean API Routes - Database-First Backend" code]
```

#### Document 5: Comprehensive Cards Component
```
Here's the comprehensive learning cards component (the key feature):

[Paste the entire "Clean Comprehensive Learning Cards - Database Driven" code]
```

#### Document 6: Comprehensive Cards API
```
Here's the API that powers the comprehensive cards:

[Paste the entire "Comprehensive Cards API - Database Driven Content" code]
```

### Step 3: Specify Implementation Order
```
Please implement in this exact order:

1. BACKUP & CLEANUP: Create backup branch, delete hardcoded files
2. CLEAN APP STRUCTURE: Create CleanApp.jsx with database-only context  
3. API ROUTES: Implement all 6 API endpoints with database queries
4. COMPREHENSIVE CARDS: Build the rich card learning experience
5. COMPREHENSIVE CARDS API: Create the Albanian linguistic content generator
6. INTEGRATION: Connect everything and test with real Albanian data

Start with step 1 and work sequentially. Test each API route before moving forward.
```

## 🎯 Key Files to Reference

### Your Existing Database Schema
Make sure Claude Code knows about your current schema:
```
My existing database has these key tables:
- languages (code, name, native_name, active)
- courses (language_id, name, description)  
- skills (course_id, name, prerequisites, cefr_level)
- lessons (skill_id, name, position, difficulty_level)
- lesson_content (lesson_id, english_phrase, target_phrase, pronunciation_guide, cultural_context)
- users (current_language, preferences)
- user_progress (user_id, lesson_id, status, success_rate)
- spaced_repetition (user_id, content_id, next_review, ease_factor)
- verbs (infinitive, conjugations, usage_examples) [if exists]
- comprehensive_lessons (lesson_id, content_data) [if exists]

Don't modify the schema - just use what exists.
```

### Current Project Structure
```
My current project structure:
rarelanguages/
├── src/app/
│   ├── page.js (main entry point)
│   └── api/ (API routes)
├── components/ (React components)
├── lib/
│   ├── database.js (PostgreSQL connection)
│   └── spacedRepetition.js (algorithm)
├── contexts/ (React context)
└── package.json

Use Next.js App Router for API routes.
Use PostgreSQL with existing connection in lib/database.js
```

## 🔍 Validation Commands

After Claude Code implements each step, you can validate:

### Test Database Connection
```
node -e "
const { query } = require('./lib/database');
query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lesson_content WHERE target_phrase IS NOT NULL')
  .then(r => console.log('✅ Albanian content count:', r.rows[0]))
  .catch(e => console.error('❌ DB error:', e));
"
```

### Test API Routes
```bash
# Test after Step 3
curl http://localhost:3000/api/languages/available
curl http://localhost:3000/api/lessons/next -H "Authorization: Bearer test-user-id"
```

### Test App Flow
```bash
# Test after Step 6
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# 1. Select Gheg Albanian
# 2. Click "Continue Lesson"  
# 3. Choose "Deep Learning Cards"
# 4. Verify rich Albanian content loads
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria Checklist

Give this to Claude Code for final validation:
```
Final validation checklist:
□ Zero hardcoded content anywhere in codebase
□ All data comes from PostgreSQL database
□ Language selection shows real Albanian with lesson count  
□ Course dashboard shows real skill tree
□ Comprehensive cards show rich Albanian content
□ Audio pronunciation works (Web Speech API)
□ Progress tracking updates database
□ Spaced repetition schedules reviews
□ Mobile-responsive design
□ Clean error handling (no fallbacks)

Test user flow:
□ Fresh browser → Select Albanian → See course dashboard
□ Click lesson → Choose comprehensive cards → See rich content
□ Complete cards → Rate difficulty → See progress saved
□ Return later → See items due for review
```

## 📋 Troubleshooting Guide

If Claude Code encounters issues:

### Database Connection Problems
```
Check your .env file has:
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string

Test connection:
npm run test-db  # or whatever your test command is
```

### Missing Content
```sql
-- Check Albanian content exists
SELECT l.name, COUNT(lc.id) as content_count
FROM languages l
JOIN courses c ON l.id = c.language_id  
JOIN skills s ON c.id = s.course_id
JOIN lessons les ON s.id = les.skill_id
JOIN lesson_content lc ON les.id = lc.lesson_id
WHERE l.code = 'gheg-al'
GROUP BY l.name;
```

### API Route Failures
```
Check Next.js App Router structure:
src/app/api/lessons/[lessonId]/route.js ✓
src/app/api/lessons/[lessonId].js ✗ (wrong location)
```

This complete package gives Claude Code everything they need to implement your clean, database-driven Albanian learning platform! 🇦🇱
