# ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡± Albanian Learning App - Development Tips

## ðŸš€ Daily Development Workflow

### 1. **Start Your Development Environment**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the app
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Monitor database (optional)
# Use PGAdmin to view/edit Albanian content
```

### 2. **Test Learning Experience**
- Visit http://localhost:3000
- Create test user account
- Go through Albanian lessons
- Note any UX improvements needed

### 3. **Customize Content**
**Add new Albanian phrases via PGAdmin:**
```sql
INSERT INTO lesson_content (lesson_id, english_phrase, target_phrase, cultural_context, difficulty_score)
VALUES (1, 'My custom phrase', 'Fraza ime', 'Context note', 3);
```

**Adjust lesson difficulty:**
```sql
UPDATE lesson_content 
SET difficulty_score = 5 
WHERE english_phrase LIKE '%complex phrase%';
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Improvement Areas to Focus On**

## ðŸ“Š **Monitoring Your Learning App**

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- Lesson completion rates
- Time spent per exercise  
- Most difficult phrases (high error rate)
- User retention and progress

### **Database Monitoring Queries:**
```sql
-- Most difficult phrases (if tracking errors)
SELECT english_phrase, target_phrase, difficulty_score
FROM lesson_content 
ORDER BY difficulty_score DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Lesson popularity
SELECT l.name, COUNT(up.id) as active_users
FROM lessons l 
LEFT JOIN user_progress up ON l.id = up.current_lesson_id 
GROUP BY l.id, l.name;
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX Improvement Ideas**
