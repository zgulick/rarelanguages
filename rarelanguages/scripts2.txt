I need you to fix my lesson flow. The clean architecture you built works great, but lessons are asking "How do you say..." before teaching anything. That's backwards!

I need proper textbook methodology: Teach → Practice → Test

Also fix the academic skill names like "Phonological Foundations" - I want "Albanian 1: Family & Greetings"

Here are the detailed instructions and complete implementations:
