# Phase 4.1: Backend API Development - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Successfully Delivered All 6 API Endpoints

### Core API Endpoints
1. **`GET /api/lessons/next`** - Powered by spaced repetition algorithm
2. **`GET /api/lessons/[id]`** - Complete lesson content with phrases
3. **`POST /api/progress/update`** - Real-time progress tracking with spaced repetition
4. **`GET /api/review/queue`** - Prioritized review items from algorithm
5. **`GET /api/practice/[topic]`** - Topic-based practice content
6. **`POST /api/auth/user`** - Simple user authentication for progress tracking

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- **Next.js App Router** API routes (`src/app/api/`)
- **PostgreSQL** database integration with connection pooling
- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm** fully integrated (HLR-based)
- **Database Queries** optimized with proper error handling
- **User Authentication** with guest and registered user support

### Database Integration
- ✅ Real database queries replace all mock data
- ✅ Connection pooling with error handling
- ✅ Spaced repetition algorithm calculates review intervals
- ✅ User progress tracked across lessons and exercises
- ✅ Topics organized by skills for practice mode

### Frontend Integration
- ✅ **API Client** (`lib/api.js`) with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **Updated AppContext** now uses real API calls instead of mock data
- ✅ **Loading States** and error handling in UI components
- ✅ **Real-time Progress** updates with backend synchronization
- ✅ **User Sessions** with localStorage persistence

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Learning Session Flow
1. **User Authentication** → Creates/loads user with progress data
2. **Next Lesson** → Spaced repetition algorithm determines what to study
3. **Lesson Content** → Real phrases loaded from database
4. **Exercise Completion** → Progress tracked with response quality (1-5)
5. **Spaced Repetition Update** → Algorithm schedules next review time
6. **Progress Tracking** → User's lesson completion and accuracy updated

### Review System
- Algorithm identifies overdue items
- Prioritizes by urgency and difficulty
- Updates intervals based on performance
- Integrates with main lesson flow

### Practice Hub
- Shows content from completed lessons
- Organized by topics/skills
- Tracks mastery levels
- Allows targeted practice
